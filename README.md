# Discord-Bot
> A little note on using the bot<br>
1. Slash commands:
   - /welcome - get welcomed by the bot
   - /roles - display all roles on the server
   - /scgv - secret cat-girl voice (one of my friends really hates it)
   - /say - make the bot say a message
   - /emote - express your emotions through text
   - /giverole - give a user a role
   - /getacat - bot sends you a cat picture (not a cat-girl!1!11!!)
2. Text listener:
   - !sayHi - make the bot say "HI"
   - !help - get command list
3. Guild listener:
   - The Bot monitors the joining or leaving of a guild member
